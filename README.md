# Hey there! 👋
I'm Henry, a Director of Products and self-proclaimed Tech Gear Junkie who loves to bring creativity and innovation to every project I work on. I was born in Thailand, I've spent most of my childhood in Germany, and I'm now based in the USA.

## What I'm up to
🚀 I'm currently leading a team of product enthusiasts as a Director of Products, brewing up innovative ideas and launching amazing products that delight users. I'm also excited to share my latest project, uncodename.com, a playful and inventive web app that generates one-of-a-kind codenames for any secret mission or project you can imagine. Whether you're planning a surprise party, building a groundbreaking app, or forming a new band, "uncodename" brings a sense of adventure and intrigue to your endeavors. With a simple click, users can effortlessly create captivating codenames, injecting an extra dose of fun and excitement into their creative pursuits.

## Bio
🌎 I love traveling and have visited several countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. My favorite places are Japan 🇯🇵, Switzerland 🇨🇭, and anywhere that inspires creativity and curiosity.

💻 As a Director of Products, my expertise lies in product management, and I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tech gear to enhance my creativity. I'm also a maker at heart and enjoy tinkering with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos.

🎉 In my free time, I like to bring some quirkiness to the world, whether it's through spinning up proof of concept projects, fiddling with home automation, or making YouTube videos. I'm also interested in learning more about making short-form content and spreading joy wherever I go.

## Skills and Tools
🚀 I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and tools to enhance my creativity. Some of my favorite products include Calendly and Grammarly (maybe products with the 'ly' ending have something to it?), but I'm also experienced in Firebase, GitHub, Cloudflare, OpenAI, and other awesome tools that help me create magic.

## Fun fact
🛍️ I'm a self-proclaimed Tech Gear Junkie and love buying the latest tech gadgets and accessories. I can't resist the temptation to try out new toys and tools, and I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing.
